INDEX PAGE PLANS

Have five drop-downs. Two on the left will be for one
bowler and two on the right will be for the other.
The drop down on the left will be for the bowler's
season, and the drop down on the right will be the
bowler's name. The outlying drop-down will be for
the oil pattern the bowlers will be bowling on.

For the sake of simplicity, this website will only
track players' stats on television shows. Therefore,
if a bowler has not made TV, they will not be on this list.
This site will also only go back to approximately 2012 or so
and will focus heavily on the FOX era of PBA bowling
(2019-present).

This website will use a MySQL database to store bowler stats.
So far, the bowler stats I have in mind are:

- Television win percentage (possibly the most important one)
- Television strike percentage
- Television spare percentage
- Ball speed
- Rev rate
- Total TV appearances
- Total tour titles
- Versatility (titles won on different patterns will
factor into this)

The oil patterns I plan to include are:

- US Open (A Future For the Sport, circa 2016-2019)
- US Open (2022-2024)
- USBC Masters (2020s)
- Cheetah
- Scorpion
- Wolf
- Badger
- Shark
- Earl Anthony
- Tournament of Champions

The bowlers I plan to include (and seasons) are:

- Jason Belmonte (2012-2024)
- Kris Prather (2018-2024)
- Jakob Butturff (2014-2024)
- Shawn Maldonado (2015-2024)
